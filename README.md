# Custom BI project analyzing the relationship between Dogecoin price trends and U.S. interest rates over the last 5 years.
# 📊 Dogecoin vs. Fed Interest Rate (2021–2025)

This project compares the historical performance of **Dogecoin (DOGE)** with changes in the **U.S. Federal Funds Rate** to analyze how cryptocurrency prices respond to monetary policy. Using Python and Power BI, the notebook demonstrates how speculative digital assets interact with traditional financial indicators.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Identify visual patterns between DOGE price movements and Fed rate changes
- Analyze percent change and volatility in DOGE over time
- Visualize correlations and trendlines for exploratory insights

## 📈 Visualizations

Here are the core charts generated:

- 📉 **Dogecoin vs Fed Funds Rate (Dual-axis Line Chart)**  
  Monthly time series comparing DOGE closing prices and Fed interest rates

- 🔄 **Monthly Percent Change in DOGE Price**  
  Captures short-term price volatility and shifts in momentum

- 📊 **Trendline Plot with Linear Regression**  
  Predictive-style overlay showing directional trends for both variables

> Visualizations are created using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and also exported to Power BI (`dogecoin_vs_fed.pbix`)

 📌 Insights

    DOGE price volatility is loosely correlated with rate changes but reflects more speculative behavior.

    Sharp spikes in DOGE don't always align with Fed policy shifts.

    This analysis offers a foundation for exploring market psychology during monetary tightening or easing cycles.
